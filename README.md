# Render Engine[Rust]

The goal for this entire project is to introduce a simple render engine to people who know nothing about programming, and little mathematical background.

The project will focus on teaching individuals how to use the correct mathematical techniques to apply them to a program, to render 3D-meshes onto a Window.
